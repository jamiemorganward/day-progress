# day-progress
A probably-useless, tiny experiment to display the progress of the day's sunlight as a percentage.

I built this as a little encouragement to make the most of my daily sunlight hours. It displays the progress of the sun across the sky as a percentage (hint: you can also look outside for a vanilla version instead).
